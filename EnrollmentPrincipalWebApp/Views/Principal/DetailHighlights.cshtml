                                        <strong>Primary Care Physician (PCP)</strong><br>
                                        When you enroll with your Insurer, you must choose a primary care physician or a "primary care physician" (PCP). This will be the main doctor you will see to handle most of your health care. This includes checkups, treatment for colds and flu, health problems and medical exams. Your PCP can find and treat health problems at an early stage. Also, you will have your medical history and you will be able to see the full picture of your health care. Your PCP also keeps track of the health care you need. There are different types of doctors who function as PCPs. These are:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p>You must choose a PCP for each insured member in your family. Your family members may have different PCPs.</p>

                                        <strong>Primary Medical Group (PMG)</strong><br>
                                        Primary Medical Group (PMG) is a group of doctors who help organize your health care services and work with your Insurer to make sure you get the care you need. Your ID card shows the name of your PCP and the number of your Primary Medical Group.
