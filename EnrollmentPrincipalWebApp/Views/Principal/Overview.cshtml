                    <p><strong>VITAL, health is in your hands</strong></p>
                    <p>The VITAL Health Plan gives you a solid, complete and more accessible health system for you. You and your eligible family members can select one of four Insurers that offer the same coverage for medical services throughout the island.</p>
                    <p>The VITAL Health Plan:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides better access to medical services throughout the island.</li>
                        <li>Promotes the highest quality of medical care.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can choose to stay with the Insurer assigned to you or change to the Insurer of your choice.</p>
                    <p>Remember: You only need to call if you want to make a change or need guidance.</p>
                    <p>Each year, beneficiaries will have a single opportunity to change their Insurer during the Open Enrollment Period. After the Open Enrollment Period ends, beneficiaries can change their Insurer at any time, but only if there is a Just Cause. For more information look in the Beneficiary's Guide.</p>
                    <p class="titulo--color card--background"><strong>All Insurers under the VITAL Health Plan offer the same health services coverage. However, each Insurer has its own network of providers composed of doctors, medical groups and hospitals that you can compare in this portal.</strong></p>
                    <p>If you need to receive guidance on the new health model or provider networks of Insurers you can call the VITAL Counseling Center through numbers <strong>1-833-253-7721</strong> or <strong>1-800-981-2737</strong>.</p>

For example, you can identify with which Insurer the primary physician and / or specialist of your choice are hired. You can use this portal to change Insurers. To change Insurers you must select a primary doctor and a primary medical group.</p>
